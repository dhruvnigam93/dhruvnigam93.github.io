All undergrads at Ashoka, a liberal arts university in India, must take 9 foundational courses before getting
into
their major. These are - _Introduction to Critical Thinking_, _Great Books, Literature and the World, Indian
Civilizations,
Environmental Studies, Mind and Behaviour, Economy, Politics and Society, Mathematical Thinking and Principles of
Science._
From their website -
> These courses are not formal gateways into the Major programmes, but distinctive courses that introduce students to
> the foundations of thought and various styles of thinking, and also to inter- and transdisciplinary approaches.

The liberal arts program at Princeton[2] has a similar stated intention.

> A liberal arts education offers an expansive intellectual grounding in all kinds of humanistic inquiry. By exploring
> issues, ideas and methods across the humanities and the arts, and the natural and social sciences, you will learn to
> read critically, write cogently and think broadly. These skills will elevate your conversations in the classroom and
> strengthen your social and cultural analysis; they will cultivate the tools necessary to allow you to navigate the
> world’s most complex issues.


When I came across this, a pang of jealousy stung me. My education since I was 16 has been about increasing depth in
mathematics. Consequently,
mathematics
has been the dominant framework I use to understand the world. Faced with something new, I try
to figure out what the _data generative process_ is, what _random variables_ are involved, and what equations can
explain this.
Sometimes this works, but when it doesn't, I am left with a feeling of inadequacy. For instance, I can reason
why very large
over-parameterized Neural Networks obtain great generalization performance. I am, however, unable to understand why
people
are willing to die for their religion, why the RBI does not decrease interest rates when inflation is stable, or why
communism is hated so much.

This has gotten worse as I have gotten older. I have doubled down on my narrow view of the world by choosing work that
rewards it
and
by hanging around with people who think similarly. I have worked myself into a bubble.

Fortunately, though, part of me was always instinctively aware of my ignorance even if I could not articulate it. It was this instinct
that
drew me
to minor in Humanities while majoring in Electrical Engineering. It is the reason I am drawn to books and podcasts[3]
that might help me understand the world better. Coming across the idea of a liberal arts education articulated and
formalised this instinct. It concretely listed down areas worthy of study that I missed out on.

Intellectually starved, I found the liberal arts curriculum mouthwatering and caught myself wondering
what would have
happened had I gone through such a program instead - if I had been deprived of an education that could have bettered my
understanding of the world. However, I could not bask in my victimhood for long. I was quickly reminded that even
if I had gone
through such a program, I would have only seen it as an obstacle to getting good grades - to get a good job - to prove
I was smart. Understanding the world was not a priority at the time.

Older and arguably wiser, I continue the fight against my ignorance by reading and listening to people who can help me marginally
bridge the
gaps in my education. I feel good having armed myself with the reading list of Ashoka's foundation courses which I am
sharing below for fellow lost souls. What I could not get in the classroom, I might squeeze out of my Kindle.
