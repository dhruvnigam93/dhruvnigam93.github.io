I first moved to Mumbai circa 2005, barely a teenager. Six cities and seventeen years later,  I find myself back in the city. My memory from that first time is peculiar. I  remember seemingly superficial things with distinct clarity - the view from a bedroom window, from where I could see local trains flying past *Seawoods* station, or the tiles in the park on the way to my friend's building where I used to go play football. But I can’t remember how I felt those days, what I thought about when I was alone, or what kind of a person I was. That kid and I feel like strangers who happened to inhabit the same body at different times. Just like passengers on the same train who get on and off at different stations, never meeting. However, I do remember the instant I first saw and became aware of the phenomenon of a local train. And it broke my brain.  

Before this, a train was a somewhat mythical vessel that transported you to worlds so far away, that you didn’t even enquire about the distance, just how many days it would take to get there. These worlds were so different from your own, that you would still be making sense of them weeks after you had returned. Tickets were reserved months in advance and were confirmed if the gods were willing. You told everyone you knew about this adventurous undertaking. Preparation started weeks in advance. Nervous energies built up as the day of departure arrived and you scrambled to figure out how to pack a miniature version of your world into ugly VIP suitcases with metallic latches. We went over the checklist over and over. Inform the neighbors, and give them contact information in case they need to reach you while you are away(no mobile phones yet). The milkman was told to stop until further notice. On days leading up to departure, recipes for meals were tailored to empty out every last perishable item from the refrigerator. This made for some interesting, and often surprisingly good culinary outcomes. 

Come D-day, hours from departure, time accelerated as you took a taxi to the city’s train station -  crossed long footbridges to your platform with your luggage, which almost equaled your weight, and finally climbed onto your compartment. The compartment that would be your home, along with 70 others, for the foreseeable future.  

After everyone had eased into their berths in the compartment -  new friends were made, meals were shared, and games were played while the vessel warped through open fields of nothingness - much like a spaceship would - at a speed that was hard to grasp since there was nothing to measure it against, apart from the occasional other train that whizzed past in the opposite direction - an event that brought all conversations to a standstill and jolted hundreds out of peaceful slumber. 

When the journey neared its conclusion, one got attached to the compartment - its people, the berths, the food. People started disappearing one by one - onto platforms at their destination. Some exchanged numbers and empty promises were made to stay in touch. As we got down to our destination, we felt - satisfied, tired, and homesick -everything that one would feel at the end of an adventure although ours had just begun. 

It was this romanticism - for which my childhood experiences are to be blamed - that was shattered by the brutally practical and sacrilegious *local* train. How could there be more than one train station in one city? It was as absurd as a person having more than one name. Aren’t stations just named after the cities they are in? There should have been one Mumbai station. How could there then be more than 1 in the same city? Did I live in Seawoods, Navi Mumbai, or Mumbai?

I saw people walk into the station, buy a ticket(if they felt like it), and within 5 minutes be in a running train, hanging by what looked like the shorter and fatter cousin of the hangers in our wardrobe. Trains were smaller, had no berths, and came every few minutes. People climbed on them even before they made their brief two-minute stoppage. 

I would take the train with my parents every Saturday from Seawoods to Vashi to shop at BigBazaar for groceries before a ceremonious lunch at McDonald's - which I looked forward to the whole week. At school, I heard that kids took the train all by themselves without their parents. I also overheard that they frequently *changed lines*. I had no idea what *changing lines* meant but for some reason, it was for me the ultimate act of valor, something I would never even think to attempt. It was crushing that kids my age were capable of such feats. I was jealous and curious. It was the early days of the internet and I was able to obtain this image at 56kbps through my modem.

<center>This might haven been the most downloaded image at some point of time. I have personally looked at it enough to memorize the paper folds at Panvel and Belapur</center>

This image intimidated me into submission. I made peace with shuttling between Seawoods and Vashi, which did not need a change of line, under the protection of my parents.

Three years went by and it was time to leave. We packed our stuff and got on a REAL train. We traveled eighteen hours to get to a faraway place. We got down at our destination station. It was the only train station in the city. 

I was back four years later for college. But it wasn’t until I was forced to commute daily from Jogeshwari to Churchgate that I truly embraced the local trains as a part of my life. With time, I  memorized almost all major stations for all 3 lines and could recommend to you where to change lines(!) to get somewhere without looking at a map. I found myself no longer intimidated by conversations about train routes and the relative quality of trains on different lines(western > harbor>central). Trains became for me the default way to get around Mumbai. I loved eavesdropping on other people’s conversations, standing by the open door when the train was less crowded, and walking through busy markets that led to the stations.

Compared to the half dozen other cities I’ve lived in, Mumbai fits me the best. But I wasn’t born here. So I can’t tell people I'm *from* here when the question is asked - although this is the city I *feel* the most from. The closest I can come to being recognized as a Mumbaikar is when I share my local train stories and struggles. The moment they realize you’ve hung by the same hangers as them, squeezed by flesh and bones on all sides, you’ll see that subtle but unmissable nod of approval from your fellow Mumbaikar. The one that says - “Aah, he's okay. He’s one of us.“
