People are not reisk averse but ambiguity averse.
Ambiguity means not having a framwork to assess the risk.
Ambiguity phile people are necessarily risk phile but not the other way round.
The need to check boxes and make dicisions as soon as possible. Mind fools you into looking past loopholes in a theory that explains away ambiguity. Make decisions fast - settle for lesser informatin.
