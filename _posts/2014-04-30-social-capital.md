In my career so far, I have been a huge benefactor of free tools and information. I have continuously had access to the best tools and infomration needed to to my job for the cost of a decent internet connection. This has been made possible by the open source movement in software(R, python) as well as a subsequent rise in free online education(think Wikepedia,reddit,coursera et al.). The saying goes that there are no free lunches, but in the case of information and technology, it seems that not ony are there free lunches, in most cases they are in fact the best lunches - better than the paid alternatives.
This violates a few paradims of the physical world where we live in where the good stuff always has to be paid for. And almost nothing, which is worth anything to you, is free. There are a bunch of fundamental reasons why software has divereged in this respect from the real world, which I might cover at a later point. For now, I want to focus on one particular aspect - the incentives for individuals to contribute to open source software and resources. An exhanusive list can be found [here](http://www.linfo.org/open_source_development_incentives.html). 

I imagine that like me, a lot of people working in software or related insustries in general, would want to help the open source movement in information and software. There are a few relatively obvious ways we could go about it. The first and the most direct way would be to contribute to it yourself. Contribute code for software projects or organise information to help people use them. This is something we all can do - to a different extent, given our abilities how much time we have. Another rather direct way would be to financially support the non-profits that help co-ordinate projects in the open source world. Think of Wikepedia or the R foundation. Again, how much and to whom is completely upto each one. Although these are straighforward ways, they are also fairly hard to take. Contributing to open source requires a lot of commitment and awareness of where the current state of the open source world is. And donating anything that would be substatial for the people involved would be a sretch for a single person.

There is another way. What if there were a way through which one could repay the contributors. Repay them with soething they could use. Sounds like what money was made for. But money is just one, albeit probably the most efficient, method to store and transfer value. Another method is through 'status'. Although it's unconventional to think this way, but if you think about it, 'Status' or 'brand' countitutes social capital. It can be values, which it is, when we tried to ealuate the 'brand value' or companies, the worth of celebraties etc. It can be transferred - via association. This happens when a celebrity associates themselves ith another brand or person and transfer.
