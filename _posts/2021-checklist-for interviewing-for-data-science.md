My answer to the question "What do you do?" differs a lot on who's asking. To relatives and uncles and auntes just trying to make small talk - I would say I work in IT. They seem to be pretty satisfied with that. I guess that is the level of resolution that they are looking for. To people within the tech industry, who are more aware of the myraid of roles within IT and software development in general, more often than not, I would asnwer that I'm a data scientist. 
For them, this is a familiar categorization and puts them at ease - the fact that they can place me into a neatly labelled drawer into their head and move on. But the times I'm really invested in a conversation, and my intentions go beyond making small talk and putting people at ease, I would say something on the lines of -"I try to give creditworthy people loans". This generally leads to a longer and much more intense conversation where I have to explain how someone who writes code all day, calculates model coefficients and plans sprints can claim something like that.

The ambiguity with data titles is a well known pehnomenon by now. And we are still at a point where these titels can be misleading, sometimes intentionally so.
Amidst this slurry of titles and job descriptions, I realised that it's important what I want to do beyond a job title. Given that one is interested in working with data and the myraid of ways that data is used in the world
